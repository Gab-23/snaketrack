.sh
- scans rulesDir and Snakefile to match oldPattern
	- grep oldPattern to match exactly
	- returns filenames
	- and inputs them in python script

.py 
- read input rules and Snakefile
- for each rule in rules:
	- extract IO
- reorder rules
	- rule all always downstream
	- track dependencies as basenames
- subset for upperBound and lowerBound
- classify change

	- outside wildcard?	
		ex: added extension to file name (e.g. .pdf) --> adjacent propagation
		ex: added new wildcard			     --> waterfall propagation
	- inside wildcard?	
		- waterfall propagation
		
	- added wildcard?
		
		
	- removed wildcad?
		- waterfall propagation
	
- swaps oldPattern with newPattern between upperBound and lowerBound of the DAG
- runs a dry-run to check if everything works
